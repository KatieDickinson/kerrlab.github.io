long_blurb: "Many bacteria contain genes on plasmids in addition to their chromosomes. Plasmids can confer advantages and costs to the host. I'm interested in this trade-off, and in determining under which environments plasmids are maintained in bacterial populations.


I'm also interested in science pedagogy, reducing achievement gaps, and exploring how active learning can best be used to increase student performance in STEM. "
