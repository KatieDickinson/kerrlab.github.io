long_blurb: "Many models of evolution assume everyone competes with everyone, and anyone can mate with anyone. This is of course not realistic; most populations are 'spatially structured'. I use mathematical modeling and computer simulation to see how spatial structure effects evolution.

Other interests:
-- evolutionary game theory
-- teaching "
