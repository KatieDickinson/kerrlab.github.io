long_blurb: "Evolutionary processes are extremely powerful. Natural selection has generated an impressive array of proteins, many of which perform complex tasks. A major mystery in molecular evolution involves the evolution of protein-protein interfaces: how does natural selection steer the diversification of new protein interactions? See here for a BEACON blog post on my work with protein evolution."
